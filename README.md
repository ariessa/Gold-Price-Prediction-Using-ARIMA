# Gold Price Prediction Using ARIMA

Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) is a widely known statistical method for time series forecasting. As such, I used
ARIMA model to perform gold price prediction on a time series dataset. ARIMA is a type of stochastic time series model that takes
error values and lag terms in calculation. It functions by relying on regressing a variable on past values.
